<!-- Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.  --> We follow the functional checklist and then based on it, we will divide the game into smaller parts (for exp: we will have these big parts start, play, setup, turn ). And each part will require one or more methods. 
<!-- If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?  --> I will do more research on the test for the game class.
<!-- Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project. --> One will write the test while the other write the code. We also divide the it 3 into smaller parts and each of us will work on each part. 
<!-- Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project. --> after every meeting, we gave each other's feedbacks. When we disagree on something, they will explain the reason why they do it and the other after understanding the process will 1, agree or 2, suggest other ways to do if they disagree.
